                        <br>
                        <small>Tuesday, 3 July 2012</small>
                    </h2>
                    <p>As the August 1st submission date approaches, we are looking forward to receiving all the amazing submissions for Sukkahville 2012.</p>
                    <p>This year we have made special arrangements with ARC Canada, a Toronto based print shop, to print your submissions. ARC Canada is able to print your design on a 24” x 36” (ARCH D) poster mounted on foam core for $30 CDN with an additional $10 for shipping costs. At your regular print shop, you would be paying approximately $120 for this service.</p>
                    <p>Please send an email to info@sukkahville.com if you are interested in using this service. We will then send your contact information to the printing company and they will set you up with an online account where you can submit your files and pay by credit card. Please make sure to upload a Word or PDF document which contains your name, contact information and the name of your design. The print company will put this document in an envelope and fasten it to the back of your board.</p>
                    <p>Do not wait until the last minute to submit your design. The printer needs at least 48 hours to complete the work and there are over one hundred submissions that may need to be printed in the week leading up to the deadline. Get your work in to the printer as soon as possible to ensure that it is delivered to Kehilla Residential Programme by August 1st, 2012. You can still use another print service if you prefer, but this is a great deal which is hard to turn down!</p>
                    <p>Best of Luck! <br>

                        <br>
                        <small>Saturday, 5 November 2011</small>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Tuesday October 11th, 2011 marked the first night of Kehilla Residential Programme’s inaugural Sukkahville!  The Sukkahville event was inspired by New York City’s innovative Sukkah City design competition held at Union Square back in 2010. The theme of the Toronto-based competition was to re-imagine the traditional idea of a sukkah with a contemporary sustainable design approach. Artists, architects and designers of all faiths were invited to submit their designs. Submissions were received from all over the world including, New York, Hong Kong, Mexico, Halifax and Toronto. Five sukkahs were then selected to be built for the community to experience.</p>
                    <p>The reception brought out a fantastic crowd of all backgrounds to view and experience the top five entries and vote for their favourite sukkah. Most importantly this event helped celebrate Sukkot while bringing awareness to the need for more affordable housing in Toronto.</p>
                    <p>A huge thank you to all those who participated in the event, and came out to show their support! Kehilla is already busy planning for Sukkahville 2012!</p>
                    <p>For those who missed it, or who were unable to see the sukkahs in daylight, here are some photos of the built structures.</p>
